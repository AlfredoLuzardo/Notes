**Computers are the result of many compromises**
- Cheaper
- Backwards Compatibility
- Simpler

**Definitions**:
- **Bit**: 0 or 1 
- **Byte**: 8-bit word
- **Word**: 64 bits probably, Determined by the register 
- **Register**: CPU memory that by definition stores a single word

  **64-bit computers vs 32-bit computers:** 2^64 = 2^32 * 2^32
	1,000 vs 1,000,000: twice as wide; 1,000,000 = 1000 * 1000
	
- **CPU**: fetches, decodes, and executes instructions: FDE Cycle
- **RAM**: aka "main-memory"
- **Cache**: faster, closer to CPU, more expensive than ram
- **Bus**: shared electrical pathway between devices to transfer data
- **Interpretation**: convert one instruction from a high-level-language (HLL) program to the equivalent set of low-level-language (LLL) instructions, then execute that, then repeat for next instruction
- **Compilation:** convert the entire HLL program to the equivalent LLL program, then execute that program, and you don't need HLL program again

2^6 = 64
2^10 = 1024 aka 1k

2^16 = 2^6 * 2^10 = 64k                  ANSWER THIS WAY IN CLASS
2^17 = 128k

2^20 = 1M
2^30 = 1G
2^40 = 1T

2^38 = 256G
2^29 = 512M
2^45 = 32T
2^32 = 4G

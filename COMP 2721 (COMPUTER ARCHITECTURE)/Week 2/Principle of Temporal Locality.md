- Same word being requested now, will likely be re-requested again soon. 
- Because of the principle, the cache tries to keep recent words there (don't let them get evicted).

Analogy:
- You hear someone talk about tiger woods, you can probably guess some words that they will say in the future:
	- Tiger Woods

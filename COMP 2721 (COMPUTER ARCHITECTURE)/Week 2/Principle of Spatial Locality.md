- e.g. if CPU requested word 6000, it is likely that words around 6000 will be requested
- Because of the principle of Spatial Locality, neighboring words are fetched into the cache whenever memory words are, because cache serves words faster to the CPU 

**Analogy**:
- If you hear people talking about Tiger woods, you can probably guess words they will say in the future: 
	- Golf
	- Cheater
	- Titles
	- Sports
	- Nike
- If you see someone at the store with taco shells in their basket, you can probably guess other items that will be in there too: beef, cilantro, cheese, sour cream

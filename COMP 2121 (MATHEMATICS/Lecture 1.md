**The rule of sum**
- If a first task can be performed in **m** ways, while a second task can be performed in **n** ways, and the two tasks cannot be performed simultaneously, then performing either task can be accomplished in any one of **m + n** ways.

**Example 1**:
- A computer science instructor has two colleagues
- One of these colleagues has 3 different textbooks on the analysis of algorithms and the other has 5 such different textbooks.
- How many different books can the instructor borrow from them?

					5 ≤ answer ≤ 8
			3 books overlap       no overlap


**The rule of product**
- If a procedure can be broken down into first and second stages, and if there are **m** possible outcomes for the first stage, and if, for each of these outcomes, there are n possible outcomes for the second stage, then the total procedure can be carried out, in the designated order, in **mn** ways.

**Example 2**:
	a) How many 16 bit strings start with 1101?

- Instance variables are private
- Most instance variables are final
- Always use clear names for data and methods
- Always include units in variable names
- JavaDoc the following:  
	- the class  
	- non-private constants  
	- non-private constructors  
	- non-private methods
- User private static validation methods
- Use constructor chaining to avoid code duplication
- local variables should be final
- Declare and initialize variables in separate lines
- Use initializer blocks for complex logic
- Compare objects (including Strings) using .equals()
- Never use magic numbers; use SYMBOLIC_CONSTANTS instead
- Use the principle of least privilege: make everything private and final if you can; if not, make it as restricted as you can while still allowing the application to run

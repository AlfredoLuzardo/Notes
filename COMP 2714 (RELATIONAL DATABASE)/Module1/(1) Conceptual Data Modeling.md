**Conceptual Database Design**
- Very important phase in designing successful database application

**Step One** - Identify the *Universe of Discourse* (UoD).
- UoD means the database will not model everything in the world, but rather a mini world

**Step Two** - Convert the UoD to a data model -> database captures data model.
- A model is never perfect
